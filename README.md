# Pyspark and Selenium on Docker
---------

*I updated docker-compose for these two processes. Run **<code>docker-compose up</code>**, all of data will be collected and loaded into Azure SQL Server.*

---------

**1. Selenium on Docker**

<img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/images/Selenium_Folder.png">

This folder contains code to run a crawler that get data from Soundcloud.com and save it into data folder. The crawler runs on Docker and data generated in a built container is mounted from container to local desktop with the docker-compose.yml .

There are steps to run app:
- <code>docker build -t crawler-img .</code>
- <code>docker run crawler-img</code>

When the contain stopped and the screen display "Crawling Successful", the data folder including Soundcloud_User.csv will exist. The file after crawling is mounted to <code>../Pyspark ETL/data/</code>

**2. Pyspark on Docker**

<img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/images/Spark_Folder.png">

When having had the Soundcloud_User.csv, I will do an ETL process to transform and load data to SoundCloudUser table in Azure SQL server. The origin folder has a (.env) folder containing credential infomation of SQL server (password, username,connection_string), so I have to hide it from repository.

Steps to run this app:
- Configure the essential infomation in .env file
- <code>docker build -t etl-img .</code>
- <code>docker run etl-img</code>

When all of data in Soundcloud_User.csv tranformed and loaded to database, the notification "Successful" will be displayed.

**3. Execute ETL piple with Shell Script**

I have add new shell script `spark_submit.sh` to combine all commands needed to build up Spark Master&Worker and submit ETL pipeline to master node

Initially, the Spark Master and Workers are installed with docker compose. The differences compared to methods as above is Spark Resources created seperated and my works do submitting to the master node

Steps:

- Open the project
- Run `chmod +x spark_submit.sh`
- <code>source ./spark_submit.sh</code>
